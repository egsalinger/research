This is the collection of work (and possibly LaTex documents) regarding the work I'm doing/will be doing.

The code is primarily in Python (which I learned when I was 12, and then proceeded to never use). It uses the pygraphviz library and a couple of files (which probably won't be uploaded because they are really large).

Merged.DOT is a graph file based off of the research data (some very large amount of twitter data). Additional datasets may be created and supplied as needed.

script.py is a simply python file that acts off of the twitter data and the graph of the tweeters to print out each tweeter's list of followed people and the number of their respective tweets.

l-shell.py is a python script that attempts to implement the l-shell algorithm for particular nodes in a graph.
